      "You are dead ... wait you already know that.",
      "Did I let the stove on...?",
      "Should have shot back first...",
      "Yep, that\u0027s messed up...",
      "Rage incomming!",
      "I think you dropped something.",
      "Time for a break?",
      "Oops, that\u0027s gonna leave a mark.",
      "You\u0027ll do better next time. Probably.",
      "Who needs a health bar anyway?",
      "Look, the game\u0027s just warming up.",
      "At least it wasn\u0027t lava.",

      "Don\u0027t worry, nobody saw that.",
      "It\u0027s not over till you quit.",
      "They got you good this time.",
      "Was that planned? Didn\u0027t think so.",
      "It\u0027s a feature, not a bug!",
      "Your enemies salute you. Sort of.",
      "No pain, no gain, right?",
      "You\u0027ll laugh about this later. Maybe.",
      "Guess you weren\u0027t ready for that.",
      "That\u0027s one way to test physics.",
      "Take a deep breath and try again.",
      "You\u0027ve been officially humbled.",
      "That\u0027s a tough lesson learned.",
      "It\u0027s not failure, it\u0027s feedback.",
      "Look on the bright side, respawns exist.",
      "You\u0027ll bounce back stronger. Hopefully.",
      "That\u0027s not how the pros do it.",
      "It\u0027s okay, mistakes happen.",
      "Sometimes you win, sometimes you respawn.",
      "You\u0027re just testing the limits.",
      "Could\u0027ve been worse. Maybe.",
      "That\u0027s what quick saves are for.",
      "You\u0027re learning... the hard way.",
      "Now you know what not to do.",
      "Well, that\u0027s one strategy.",
      "You\u0027re not alone; everyone\u0027s been there.",
      "They\u0027ll tell stories about this day.",
      "Your spirit animal is now a phoenix.",

      "You took one for the team. Unfortunately, no one noticed.",
      "Whoops! Wrong button?",
      "So close, yet so far.",
      "Rest in pieces.",
      "That\u0027s a respawn-worthy performance.",
      "Looks like you missed the memo.",
      "Is this your first time playing?",
      "Well, that was... something.",
      "Keep trying, you\u0027re getting there.",
      "Your enemies send their regards.",
      "Death is just the beginning.",
      "Respawning is an art.",

      "Don\u0027t worry, you\u0027ll get the hang of it.",
      "Was that a tactical choice?",
      "You\u0027ll need a bigger health bar for that.",
      "Practice makes perfect... eventually.",
      "Looks like they had the high ground.",
      "Good try. Better luck next time.",
      "Maybe you should try a different strategy.",
      "Death is temporary, respawn is forever.",
      "Respawning: the ultimate skill.",
      "Time to reconsider your life choices.",
      "Look at the bright side: no more pain.",

      "They really got you this time.",
      "Every death is a chance to improve.",
      "You\u0027re a natural at respawning.",
